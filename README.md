ShramSaathi is a full-stack job discovery platform built for blue-collar workers to find relevant job listings near them — filtered by district and work type.  Built with Spring Boot + React, the app enables local job discovery, employer job posting, and worker registration — aiming to bridge the informal employment gap in India.
